PLAYER
-Since we're rolling with the idea that you are the monster, I think we should have the player gradually 'level up' 
or evolve into a stronger character throughout the successive waves. At first he can start as a human-octopus hybrid, 
that has tentacle attacks. Light attack, heavy (or melee and ranged?) and grapple. Then he become better and gets bat wings, for jumping/aerial 
attacks (or dodging or changing elavation). Wings can then fold in front of the character to act as a shield for blocking.
Disolve shader with semi-transluscent end image can serve as a 'hide' or stealth ability (especially useful for taking down 
bosses and brutes).

-Either that, or have the character be one of two or three classes, all different cephalopods: either an octopus-person, a 
cuttle-fish person or a squid person. Octopus is the agile build (8 tentacles for quick attacks), cuttlefish is the tank build 
(with the shell and all) and squid is the assualt build (hooks on two tentacles). Unlock some crab claws.

-Or we can mix and match different things. Start off as an octopus-person with tentacle attacks. Collect wings (or unlock them) 
to change elavation (and mayb block). Unlock hooks to inflict bleed attacks with tentacles. Collect carapace/chitin for armour 
buffs, lose tentacles (max of 8) when health is lost (0 = death). tentacles regrow.

ENEMIES
-'Norms' ar just evryday villages yokels that are freaked out b the monster. They only basic weapons (Spade, pitchfork, broom). 
-'Heavies' are militia, police.
-'Brains' are hive-mind/commander units, that hang in the back of a small group of norms, which it 'sends' to try surround or
 flank the player.
-'Brutes' are various Lovecraftian monsters that are fearing the rise of the player character, e.g. Shogoths, others
-'Bosses' are Elder things, gods.

GENERAL MECHANICS
-TO-DO mentions a different currency for abilities. I suggest that we make a 'Elder Font', 'Aether' (Void Aether?) or other
magical resouce for this. Or DNA/RNA, which the player character uses to develop enough 'currency' to evolve abilities from 
a skill tree.
-Maybe the character can use RNA/DNA/Blood to grow armour (i.e. carapace/chitin).
